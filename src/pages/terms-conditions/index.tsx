      You should be aware that there are certain things that Optochka will not
      take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app
      to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or
      provided by your mobile network provider, but Optochka cannot take
      responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t
      have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
      If you’re using the site outside an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember
      that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will
      still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for
      the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the
      site, or other third-party charges. In using the site, you’re accepting
      responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you
      use the app outside your home territory (i.e. region or country) without
      turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on

      received permission from the bill payer for using the site. Along the same
      lines, site cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the site
      i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out
      of battery, and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, site cannot
      accept responsibility. With respect to Optochka’s responsibility for your
      use of the site, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind
      that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all
